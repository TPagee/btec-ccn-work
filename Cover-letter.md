Dear Tom,

I recently saw your job application for a Junior Software Engineer at a software development agency in Birmingham. I am very interested in the position as I'd agree I fill a number of your requirements.

I am a young tech enthusiast with a strong passion for programming both with old and new technologies. I have a lot of experience programming back-ends in Node JS and MongoDB. I am a perfectionist with my code but understand the difference between development and production quality code. I enjoy working with the latest technologies and love to learn new techniques and services. I haven't had a lot of experience professionally coding as I haven't had many chances or opportunities to do so.

I also have a unique personality and although I can be socially kept in, I eventually learn to deal with my environment and adapt. For a more detailed and in-depth description of myself and my skills, see my resume which I have attached with this letter.

Also, just to add to my tech savviness, I used Markdown to write this and frequently use GitHub.

I hope to hear from you soon,

\- Alessandro Puricelli
